# GitHub Management via Terraform: Template

This repository is meant to serve as a template for creating new repositories responsible for managing GitHub configuration as code with Terraform. It provides an opinionated way to manage GitHub configuration without following the Terraform usage guidelines to the letter. It was designed with managing multiple, medium to large sized GitHub organisations in mind and that is exactly what it is/is going to be optimised for.

**IMPORTANT**: Having write access to GitHub Management repository can be as powerful as having admin access to the organizations managed by that repository.
