# Collateral for Saturn's L1 nodes - design document

#### Maria Silva, November 2022

In this report, we detail how the collateral mechanism for Saturn's L1 node operators functions and the principles underlying the design. We also provide more details about how the collateral value is estimated.

## Motivation and principles

Saturn is a decentralized network of nodes that work together to deliver online content fast. This means that anyone that meets the hardware requirements can join, contribute resources and collect payments from that contribution. This permissionless nature of the system means that the network is open to a set of attacks that need to be mitigated with the right incentive design.

One of those design choices is the application of [penalties](https://hackmd.io/@cryptoecon/SJIJEUJbs/%2FMqxcRhVdSi2txAKW7pCh5Q#Penalties).
