## Reward distribution options

Before discussing what options there are for distributing rewards among Station Operators, there are some principles we wish to meet:

1. Simplicity over complexity -> we only add complexity if it serves a purpose and, thus, we try to build the simplest process that achieves the goal.
2. Bounded rewards -> since we are still in a testing phase, we should limit the daily rewards to avoid overspending in case of DDoS attacks and other anomalous behavior
3. Incent a reliable and performant service -> these are the two main attributes we care about when designing incentives. First, we want Operators to serve a high volume of retrievals with a high bandwidth / fast upload time. Second, we want Operators to be reliable and fail gracefully.
4. Incent honesty -> Operators should be incentivized to report their own faults
5. Preference towards free market -> we try to leverage free market mechanics and supply-demand to avoid having to set a price for content delivery. Price setting on new services is a hard problem and letting the market decide on the market is a good design when we have price uncertainty.

:::warning
:warning: Open question: do we want to incent actual service or offered service? E.g., do we want to reward the actual bandwidth delivered (which depends on the clients and other external factors) or do we want to reward the bandwidth the Operator is capable of providing?

### Reward pool

Fixed vs. variable

Single vs. multiple

### Penalties

Decrease rewards? How much?
